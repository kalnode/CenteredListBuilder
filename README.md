**Centered List Builder v1.0**


**DEMO:** https://kalnode.github.io/CenteredListBuilder


**DESCRIPTION:**

A helper for building and styling centered HTML lists!

This tool generates a non-standard list style, perhaps useful in creative typography, described as such:

* Centered and bulleted
* Evenly (or nicely) spaced items
* Responsive and dynamic
* Uses plain HTML structure
* Ideally CSS-only
* ... and has no bullet appearing on the start or end of a line.

To make such a list requires some CSS and/or JS tricks!


**INSPIRATION: Musical festival posters!**

Music festival posters traditionally have a dense band list (aka "the lineup"), where list items have seperators (like dots) and seperator never occurring on the edges of the list. Such lists you only ever see in fixed print designs, and rarely do you see it in a responsive form, such as on a website.
